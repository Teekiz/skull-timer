# Emblem Trader Skull Timer
A plugin that displays a timer when your character receives a skull from the emblem trader. Useful for ironmen and lower level main accounts looking to maintain the best drop rates while in the Revenant Caves.

A timer will appear as an infobox (default top left) and will countdown until the skull status is removed. The timer will only appear when recieving a skull from the emblem trader (found in Edgevile or the Revenant Caves). The infobox will be removed if the timer expires or the player looses the skull effect. Configuration options can be used to changed the normal and warning text (default white and red respectively).
