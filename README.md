This plugin tracks the players skull duration and status. 

This is particularly useful for ironmen and lower-level main accounts aiming to maximize drop rates in Revenant Caves or for tracking the duration of the skull status in PvP scenarios.

## Features

- Real-time Skull Status Timer
- PvP Combat Detection
- Equipment Monitoring
- Configurable Alerts
- Abyss Teleport Handling

## How it works

1. Receiving a Skull: The plugin detects when the player gets a skull icon and starts a timer accordingly.

2. Timer Visibility: A skull countdown timer is displayed in an infobox.

3. Automatic Updates: The timer adjusts based on interactions with NPCs and other players.

4. Expiration & Removal: The timer is removed when the skull expires or the player dies
